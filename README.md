# MQTT-based-IoT-System-for-Home-Automation
This project demonstrates the use of MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for IoT communication between devices. The system will publish temperature data from a sensor to an MQTT broker and allow other devices to subscribe to it.  Hardware:      ESP8266 (or ESP32)     DHT11 or DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
